                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>I am a soon-to-be-graduated Computer Engineer from Dublin with an interest in Computer Vision and
                    tech in agriculture. I have experience working in high-paced startups, where a broad array of skills
                    in backend, ML and AWS were all required.
                    This year, I will graduate with a distinction in Computer Engineering (Masters level) at Trinity
                    College Dublin, where I focussed my fifth year on the research and development of a Mobile Tennis
                    Analysis Sytem, under the supervision of Dr. Kenneth Dawson-Howe.

                <h3><b>ML Intern</b></h3>
                <p>
                    R.Grid | 2021
                </p>
                <p>
                    R.Grid is a young, med-tech startup building research software, streamlining the outdated
                    medical research processes.
                    As ML Intern, I developed a number of services for the R.Grid application. I worked on all stages of
                    these projects' development, from project requirements to deployment to the R.Grid production
                    environment
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed, developed and deployed a useful trends analysis tool for Twitter, now deployed on
                        R.Grid
                        production.</li>
                    <li>Designed, developed and deployed an Elasticsearch-based search tool, for medical conditions and
                        their related commuities - As based on publicly available medical ontologies.</li>
                    <li>Designed, developed and deployed a Python-based asynchronous webscraper, used as a tool for the
                        marketing staff in R.Grid.</li>

                <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
                <h3><b>Mobile Tennis Analysis</b></h3>
                <p>For my Masters Dissertation, I was tasked with developing a multi-device Mobile Tennis Analysis
                    System.
                    This project was hinged on the idea that multiple mobile phones positioned on each tennis post could
                    provide a more complete outlook of a given Tennis game. For this, C++ and OpenCV were used to build
                    the application, with Python used to build a custom ground truth generation tool.
                </p>
                <h4><b>Features</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tennis Ball tracking, in each view of the court.</li>
                    <li>Bounce detection in each individual view, as well as
                    </li>
                    <li>Secure login system and interface for Emergency Services.</li>
                    <li>Disaster Verification and Updating interface for Emergency Services.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3><b>Disaster Management System</b></h3>
                <p>As part of CS7CS3, my team and I were required to put together a system that could deal with
                    disasters as they occured throughout Dublin City. The backend of the application was built using
                    Python FastAPI, and deployed to Heroku. The chosen database for this project was PostgreSQL. We
                    chose ReactJS as the frontend framework for this project.
                </p>
                <h4><b>Features</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disaster Visualisation Interface</li>
                    <li>Disaster Assessment System, where the response for each reported disaster would be decided upon.
                    </li>
                    <li>Secure login system and interface for Emergency Services.</li>
                    <li>Disaster Verification and Updating interface for Emergency Services.</li>
                </ul>
